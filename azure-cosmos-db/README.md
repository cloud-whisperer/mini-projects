<h1>Azure Cosmos DB mini-projekt  ðŸŒŒ </h1>
This PoC demonstrates how to provision, manage, and query NoSQL data using Azure Cosmos DB through the Azure portal.
<br>
<br> An Azure Cosmos DB account was created and configured with provisioned throughput. A sample database and 
<br>container were deployed, where JSON documents were inserted and modified. SQL queries were then executed in Data 
<br>Explorer to retrieve data, followed by reviewing how developers typically use SDKs for programmatic access in 
<br>production environment 
<br>
<br><h2>Example use case:</h2>
A development team needs a fast and scalable NoSQL database to prototype a catalog of product data. Azure Cosmos DB 
<br>allows them to quickly ingest, view, and query JSON documents with flexible schema support, using tools built 
<br>into the Azure portal and SDKs for integration with applications.
