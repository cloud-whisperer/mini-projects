## 🔧 What I Accomplished

🧵 Created an SNS Topic with Email Subscription
Set up an SNS topic and subscribed using a verified email address, enabling the system to push email alerts.

🟨 Deployed a Lambda Function to Trigger Notifications
Wrote a basic AWS Lambda function that publishes a message to the SNS topic, simulating an event trigger.

📫 Handled Subscription Confirmation Flow
Completed the email subscription confirmation process to activate delivery of messages to the subscriber’s inbox.
