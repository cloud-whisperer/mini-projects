## 🔧 What I Accomplished

- 🧵 Created an SNS Topic with Email Subscription.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up an SNS topic and subscribed using a verified email address, enabling the system to push email alerts.
- 🟨  Deployed a Lambda Function to Trigger Notifications.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrote a basic AWS Lambda function that publishes a message to the SNS topic, simulating an event trigger.
- 🧪  Tested Lambda Execution and Verified Email Delivery.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manually triggered the Lambda function, which sent a notification through SNS. Received the email successfully,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confirming the setupworked.
- 📫  Handled Subscription Confirmation Flow.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completed the email subscription confirmation process to activate delivery of messages to the subscriber’s inbox.
