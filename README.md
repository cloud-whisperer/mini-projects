## 📖 Projekt Overview

**Summary:** A collection of hands-on projects focused on secure cloud infrastructure, hybrid identity, and compliance-driven system design across AWS, Azure, 
Oracle, and on-premise environments.

- 🔐 Security-first architecture emphasizing least privilege, auditability, and threat visibility  
- ☁️ Practical cloud engineering using AWS and Microsoft cloud services  
- 🔑 Hybrid identity integrations bridging on-prem Active Directory with Entra ID  
- 🧱 Infrastructure as Code, automation, and repeatable deployments  
- 🧾 Compliance-aware logging, monitoring, and forensic readiness  

**Closing:**  
These projects collectively reflect an intentional learning path toward **Enterprise Hybrid Security Architecture and DevSecOps**. Each project reinforces 
real-world design patterns—identity as the control plane, infrastructure as code, and logging as a security primitive. Together, they demonstrate not only technical execution, but architectural thinking grounded in security, resilience, and operational clarity.
