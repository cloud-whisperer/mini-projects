<h1>🐝 CloudBees Mini-Project:
<br>Continuous Integration with AWS EC2 and CloudBees CI</h1>
<br>

This project demonstrates a simple Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using **CloudBees CI** (Jenkins-based) on AWS EC2 
<br>with **GitHub** for source control. The goal is to automate the deployment of a **Hello World** web application hosted 
<br>on an EC2 instance, with optional Docker integration.

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- **AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)** – Cloud server to deploy and run the web application.
- **CloudBees CI** – Jenkins-based platform for automating build, test, and deployment workflows.
- **GitHub** – Source control platform for managing the application code.
- **Docker** (optional) – Containerization for deploying the application.
