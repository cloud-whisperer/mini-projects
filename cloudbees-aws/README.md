<h1>🐝 CloudBees Mini-Project:
<br>Continuous Integration with AWS EC2 and CloudBees CI</h1>
<br>
CloudBees CI ensures a streamlined **CI/CD pipeline** for automating deployments, making it easier to manage 
<br>application code changes and updates in an efficient and reliable manner.
<br>
### Overview:
- **GitHub** hosts the application code in the **"hello-app" repository**.
- **CloudBees CI** (Jenkins-based) is used to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- The application is deployed to an **EC2 instance** running Ubuntu, serving a basic **Hello World** web server.
- **Docker** can be optionally used to containerize the application for deployment.

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- **AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)** – Cloud server to deploy and run the web application.
- **CloudBees CI** – Jenkins-based platform for automating build, test, and deployment workflows.
- **GitHub** – Source control platform for managing the application code.
